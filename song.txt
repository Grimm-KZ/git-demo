Sky of golden sun,
Steppe of golden seed,
Legend of courage -
Take a look at my country!
 
From the antiquity
Our heroic glory emerged,
They did not give up their pride
My Kazakh people are strong!


My country, my country,
As your flower I will be planted,
As your song I will stream, my country!
My native land â€“ My Kazakhstan!

The way was opened to the posterity
I have a vast land.

I have an independent country.
